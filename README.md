# Roundnet Player

A website that displays tournament statistics on roundnet players and how players are connected to each other through tournaments. This project was built in a team of two and I was responsible for the frontend. I built the frontend using React on top of the Next.js framework, using TypeScript as the main language. I also used TailwindCSS to style this website.

Through this project I learned how the frontend interacts with the backend through an API to fetch all of the data that it needs to display to the user.
